Labeling on the graphs saying what type of graph it is (LV plot etc.) but the actual 
code is labeled nicely

Some of the plots in the code are done with the standard package and some with ggplot2
This is correct in the report though
--revised: they are all in ggplot2 but some have color changes and some include a key and
other plots don't include a key

Time point should be 200 instead of 100

Need to run multiple plots for the Paradox of Enrichment (in the actual code) it was included
in the final report

The layout of the questions was really nice!

There needs to be labeling on the conceptual model to describe if it's an increase or decrease in 
each of the parameters

We really liked the report overall, it was thorough and clear
